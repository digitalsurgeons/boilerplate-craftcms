# JobScore Plugin for Craft CMS

Sync JobScore jobs to your Craft CMS pages


## Installation

To install JobScore, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `jobscore` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
3. The plugin folder should be named `jobscore` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

JobScore works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.
